		<p>Greg Lehey reflects on his 30-year journey with FreeBSD, tracing his experiences from the early days of Unix to his involvement with FreeBSD. Starting his career in 1973 at UNIAC in Frankfurt/Main, he later joined Tandem Computers, where he worked with Unix System V. In 1992, he transitioned to consulting and discovered BSD/386, which led him to explore FreeBSD. His first encounter with FreeBSD was in 1993 when he met developers at Walnut Creek CDROM and received a FreeBSD 1.0 CD-ROM. Over the years, Lehey contributed to the FreeBSD community, including authoring a book on FreeBSD installation. His timeline offers a personal perspective on the evolution of FreeBSD and his role within its community.</p>
